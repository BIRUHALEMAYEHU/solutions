# 🕒 PC Shutdown Timer 🚀

## Why? 🤔
I love listening to white noise while I sleep 😴, but my PC wouldn't shut down—just sleep mode! Not cool. So, I fixed it with some Java magic 🧑‍💻.

## How It Works 🛠️
1. Enter minutes ⏳
2. Click "Start Timer" 🖱️
3. Boom! PC shuts down 💥

## How to Use 🤓
1. Install Java (if you don’t have it).
2. Run:
   ```bash
   javac ShutdownTimerGUI.java
   java ShutdownTimerGUI
   ```
3. Done! 🎉

## Why You Need This 🔥
Tired of your PC staying on forever? Give it a rest 😎.

## License 📜
Use it freely, but hey, no complaints if it shuts down at the wrong time! 😜
